**ai**: Okay, I've updated the analysis based on the new "#daily" tags. Here's the time allocation breakdown:

**Weekdays:**

| Category | Time Allotment (approximate) |
|---|---|
| Sleep | 7.5 hours |
| Daily Routines | 1 hour 30 minutes |
| English (TOEIC + ELSA) | 1 hour 40 minutes |
| Health (Big 3 + Exercise) | 1 hour 20 minutes |
| Office Tasks | 8 hours 5 minutes |
| Solo Development | 2 hours 45 minutes |
| Light Reading | 15 minutes |

**Weekends:**

| Category | Time Allotment (approximate) |
|---|---|
| Sleep | 7.5 hours |
| Daily Routines | 1 hour 30 minutes |
| English (TOEIC + ELSA) | 3 hours 40 minutes |
| Health (Big 3 + Exercise) | 1 hour 20 minutes |
| Solo Development | 6 hours 15 minutes |
| Light Reading | 15 minutes |
| Relationship | 4 hours 30 minutes (Sunday only) |
| Review Weekly | 10 minutes |

**Overall Weekly Allocation (Estimates):**

To calculate the overall weekly allocation, I'll multiply the weekday values by 5 and add the weekend values.

*   **Sleep:** (7.5 hours \* 7 days) = 52.5 hours
*   **Daily Routines:** (1.5 hours \* 7 days) = 10.5 hours
*   **English:** (1 hour 40 minutes \* 5) + 3 hours 40 minutes = 12 hours
*   **Health:** (1 hour 20 minutes \* 7) = 9.3 hours
*   **Office:** (8 hours 5 minutes \* 5) = 40.4 hours
*   **Solo Development:** (2 hours 45 minutes \* 5) + 6 hours 15 minutes = 19.25 hours
*   **Light Reading:** (15 minutes \* 7) = 1.75 hours
*   **Relationship:** 4 hours 30 minutes
*   **Review Weekly:** 10 minutes

**Total Weekly Time Allocation:**

| Category | Time Allotment (approximate) |
|---|---|
| Sleep | 52.5 hours |
| Daily Routines | 10.5 hours |
| English | 12 hours |
| Health | 9.3 hours |
| Office | 40.4 hours |
| Solo Development | 19.25 hours |
| Light Reading | 1.75 hours |
| Relationship | 4.5 hours |
| Review Weekly | 10 minutes |

**Important Considerations:**

*   These are estimates based on the time blocks you've defined. The actual time spent may vary.
*   The "Relationship" category is only present on Sunday, so it's calculated as a single block for the week.
*   The "Review Weekly" category is only present on the weekends, so it's calculated as a single block for the week.
*   This analysis assumes that the time blocks are consistent across all weekdays.
