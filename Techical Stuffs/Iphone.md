### Iphone 16 pro max and Pro
Basically the same. Except the incremental change in battery, display and a newer sensor camera.
> If I got the money then the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">16 pro</mark> is all the way to go.

### Why shouldn't upgrade to 16 pro yet
- #less-is-more I don't need all of these new features yet (camera, external drive, SIM lock, ....)
- #money-matter The price <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">$800</mark>
	- It's too damn expensive for a fancy phone and I don't have any use of
	- I could spend more money on the thing I need (Certificate, courses, AWS cloud, ....)
- #just-fine Iphone 13 is just good enough

### When should I buy new Iphone 16 pro? #pending
- Cheaper price. (or at least I could buy 2 of them with 1 month salary)
- Have the use of that (Camera <learn to edit, or required high resolution images, high quality video)
- Apple Intelligence rolled out and I might beneficial dramatically from it
### Iphone 16 pro and 15 pro max
There is a big improvement in camera: wide lens camera from <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">12M -> 48M</mark>.
