I always wanted a successful career <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">as a [[solo developer]]</mark>. Not jus another full-time employee.
So basically I could:
+ [[bring my idea to life]].
+ Take control over my life again ([[making money]] and [[Time Management]])
+ Also get [[recognition]] and [[Seeking respect]]
### What I need to have?
