## TOEIC 900+ – Rules of Thumb

### 🎯 Goal Clarity
- **Target Score**: 910–920 in mock to feel safe for real test
- **Real Test Goal**: 900+
- **Main Motivation**: $70 bonus (~9% raise on $800/month)
    - *Short-term* Money toward -> [[3 Years plan to 500M]]
    - *Long-term* Personal dev -> [[solo developer]] and [[IELTS cert]]
---
### ⏱️ Time Management
- **Weekdays**: 45–60 mins max → *One focused block, no multitasking*
- **Weekends**: 120 mins → *Split into 2 sessions to avoid fatigue*
---
### 🧪 Test-Taking Strategy
#### 🟦 Listening (Parts 1–4)
- Always **read the questions before audio starts** (Part 3 & 4)
- **Predict answers** before hearing audio
- **Don't chase missed info** – stay focused on what's next    
- Mark "?" if unsure → review during **Listening Revise**
#### 🟧 Reading (Parts 5–7)
- **Grammar**: Solve fast – don't overthink if stuck
- **Vocabulary**: Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- **Long reading (Part 7)**: Skim questions → scan passage
- Keep pace: **~75 mins total**, spend:
    - ~25 mins on Part 5 & 6
    - ~50 mins on Part 7
---
### 🔁 Review Strategy
#### 🎧 Listening Revise
- Re-listen to entire audio or missed questions
- Open transcript → Check:
    - Keywords you **didn't hear clearly**
    - Sentences you **didn’t understand**
    - New words → add to vocabulary list
#### 📖 Reading Revise
- Note down:
    - Unknown vocabulary (include part of speech + sentence)
    - Key grammar structures
    - Why each **wrong answer is wrong**, not just why right one is correct
---
### 📘 Vocabulary Strategy
- Create **short definitions** + **1 sentence example** (no full dictionary copy)
- Group by topic (e.g. email, office, scheduling)
- Recycle in daily thoughts or notes
---
### 🧱 Grammar Rule Focus (TOEIC essentials)
- Subject–Verb agreement
- Tense usage (especially present perfect, future forms)
- Prepositions (in, on, at, to, for)
- Articles (a, an, the) — often tested
- Word forms (noun vs. verb vs. adjective)
---
### 🧠 Mental Tips
- Don’t aim for perfection → focus on **consistency + pattern recognition**
- If tired, do **review only**, not new tests    
- Your score goal is high, but your real power is **review and reflection**, not speed
---
### 🔂 Feedback Loop
- After each test set (1 test = 4 steps):
    - Note what caused wrong answers (keyword missed, grammar, vocab, careless)
    - Tag question type (L-Part 2, R-Part 6, etc.)
    - Add these patterns into "Mistake Tracker" in Obsidian
