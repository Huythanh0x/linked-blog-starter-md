### Lying upward 
I tried this but failed as I have not set up the right angle and might be discofort to use at first. Then found Pirate King Video and setup again.
##### Old setup
##### At firs mount it at my living room (into the table). 
- Try it and love it but so hot outside
##### Then move the entire setup to my bed also table. 
- The air condition
- But quite not stable as the time go by
- A wast of big space which I can utilaize to have to exercise or stand to work
##### ANd end up with mounting to the Wall.
- More Stable, higher. Permanant [[I could only WFH]]
- Regain the space to have a set up for the desk (stand, seat)
#### Setup
##### Dual monitor
I accidentially broke my LG QHD monitor so I find a new one (old 4k from my former leader)

##### ARM and mounting (the core of this setup)
- NB 80 and NB 180
- My father handmade mounting pattern
##### Thinkpad keyboard
- Super Light
- Decent typing expericen
- Trackpoint (super effecive as I'm lying down)
- Expensive and quite hard to find (I ordered it from japanese)
##### Logitech M575 track ball
- Easy to use (in this set up)
- Does have to move the hand around (just your finger)
- Quite big for my hand, and required the 3D  based to make it comfortable to use
##### 2.8" Toggl Arduino Time Tracking
There is a 2.8" [[Toggl Arduino - Time Tracking anywhere]]put in my eye-sight so that I can quickly glance and tell that how long have I been lying still. THis is important as I have [[Herniated dis at the age of 23 as developer]] And this is an effective way for my to tackle the real cause of my pain
### Seating
Nothing special, since I took back the space and can have a use it to setup my desk.
It's quite small to I put strong hard big panel on top. Then I could easily switch betweenn lying and seating within my room. Right.
But according to this research <link>, standing is much ease for the spine than seating. SO we go to the next position
##### My Macbook as main machine
My company give it for all employee, m1 8GB ram. Yeah you read it right 8GB of RAM for mobile dev in 2025
##### My Ipad gen 9 (2021) as secondary monitor
Use sidecar  feature for this purpose, sometimes required me to wired connect. But most of the time just wirelessly
**Note** I have build [[]]


### Standing
Put a smaller table of top and Have a decitated set of keyboard/mouse for 2 position(built-in key board for the mac) and external while seating
