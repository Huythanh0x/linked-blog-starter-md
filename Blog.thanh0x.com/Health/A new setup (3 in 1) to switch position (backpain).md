### Lying upward 
I tried this but failed as I have not set up the right angle and might be discofort to use at first. Then found Pirate King Video and setup again.
##### Old setup
##### At firs mount it at my living room (into the table). 
- Try it and love it but so hot outside
##### Then move the entire setup to my bed also table. 
- The air condition
- But quite not stable as the time go by
- A wast of big space which I can utilaize to have to exercise or stand to work
##### ANd end up with mounting to the Wall.
- More Stable, higher. Permanant [[I could only WFH]]
- Regain the space to have a set up for the desk (stand, seat)
### Seating
Nothing special, since I took back the sapce and can have a use it to setup my desk.

### Standing
Put a smaller table of top
