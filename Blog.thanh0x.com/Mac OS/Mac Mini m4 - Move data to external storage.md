### 1. ln -s (My old approach)
##### Only move certain folders (usually not important) to the external drive.
##### Cause a lot of issues sometimes
+ such as move the wrong folder and not link it back correctly the related app could be malfunction.
**Note of command with absolute path**
### 3. Booth from external drive (Not )
This require a fast speed SSD and enclosure (NVME with thunderbolt 4 enclosure) and it usually hot too.
