The base model (16-256) is a bargain. And 16GB ram is comfortable for most user, but the storage at 256 is still so limited. Increase to 512 is to expensive (200 dollars), while with that 200$ I could have 2TB setup in which have the same performance at 
### 1. ln -s (My old approach)
##### Only move certain folders (usually not important) to the external drive.
##### Cause a lot of issues sometimes
+ such as move the wrong folder and not link it back correctly the related app could be malfunction. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Still can boot and use the device but not related apps</mark>
##### Not maximize the external storage as some big file cannot move (Library/Caches)
The internal drive still can be max out and not usable in some cases and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">required restart</mark>
**Note of command with absolute path**

### 2. Having an user profile on the external storage
##### Still usable in case of failed SSD
##### All data are in one disk and doesn't cause not found path issue

##### Maximize the usae of the external disk (could be 1tb or 2Tb)
### 3. Booth from external drive (Not suitable for most)
##### This require a fast speed SSD and enclosure (NVME with thunderbolt 4 enclosure) 

#####  Heating issue
**Note My 2TB NVME died and lost everything and the drive was bend due to the heat**
##### Quite not safe in my opinion (connect), the SSD fail for example.
