### 1. ln -s (My old approach)
##### Only move certain folders (usually not important) to the external drive.
##### Cause a lot of issues sometimes
+ such as move the wrong folder and not link it back correctly the related app could be malfunction. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Still can boot and use the device but not related apps</mark>
**Note of command with absolute path**
### 3. Booth from external drive (Not suitable for most)
##### This require a fast speed SSD and enclosure (NVME with thunderbolt 4 enclosure) 

#####  Heating issue
**Note My 2tb NVME died and lost everything and the drive was 
##### Quite not safe in my opinion (connect), the SSD fail for example.
