### Manipulate trial
##### Reset trial
Simply remove the file which store the data to know when will the timer expired
Sample:
+ Revenue Cat
+ IntelliJ IDE
##### Adjust expired date
Before opening the app, adjust your local date time to a future in a day. So for example the app let you have 7 days of trial. When change the time to 30 days later and open the app, it trigger the app to think that the date of expired is 37 (30+7) later. Then you revert your local time and enjoy extended trial time
Sample: I can not explicitly mentioned it as there is no available reference for it. But it tried it with one of the app I'm using [[All the]]
