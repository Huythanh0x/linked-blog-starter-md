### [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#Best-practices)
- **Avoid using the same color to mean different things**
	Use color *consistently* throughout your interface
- Make sure your app’s colors work well in **both light and dark contexts**
- Test your app’s color scheme under a **variety of lighting conditions.**
- If your app lets people choose colors, prefer [[system color]] controls where available.

### [Inclusive color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#Inclusive-color)
- Avoid relying solely on color to differentiate between objects
- Avoid using colors that make it hard to perceive content in your app -> *insufficient contrast*
