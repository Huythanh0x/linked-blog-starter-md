### Central stats (todo list, time tracking stats, ....)
Yeah, definitely it's a really nice to have.
I could be seemly the webpage of
- [[Server HomePage]]
- [[Todo list]]
- [[Time Tracking Report]]
- [[Goal tracking]]
- [[Current Tracking session]]
### Wireless HDMI
Even an HDMIi have the CPU and RAM too
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Definitely doesn't worth it</mark>
Since it't not touchable. 
Expensive to have `extend monitor` feature. Cheap one only mirror

### Touch screen
MacOS doesn't support touch.
It would be better if I used another phone **Android** or **IOS** and use [[Apple sync]] or [[realtime DB]]
