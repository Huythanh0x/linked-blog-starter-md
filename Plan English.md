### My initial context (2/8/2025)
- Vietnamese, 25 years olds. Started learning English seriously since 1st year in university.
- What I have learned so far:
	- Vocab: 3000 oxford words by CERF. Still retain over 80% of that. But most passively
	- Grammar: Grammar in use (Book), the essential version
	- Reading: still read the docs daily, but still struggle on technical docs. But comfortable with Medium article and Reddit post.
	- Listening: Still listen to podcast in Apple podcast sometimes.
	- Writing: self write anything and use the AI to correct sentence and rephrase my sentence.
- Comfortable to talk a bout general conversation topic. With some grammar mistakes and also hm uh here and there
- Used to have a 6.5 [[IELTS cert]](Academic) in Dec, 2022. Speaking 6.0 and Writing 6.0
- Stop using speaking english skill for a while (since the cert taken) and joined to a Japanese company. And since then, I only used English passively (Reading and Listener for the docs)
- Took a mock TOEIC test and get score of 902 (R+L)
### My goals
#### Short-term (in months)
- Got an [[TOEIC 900 cert]] (R+L) -> apply for 70$ raise in my company.
- Be confident and comfortable to talk in general topics again.
#### Long-term (years)
- Be proficient in English, actually talk in various topics (to be specific, around [[IELTS]] 7.5)
