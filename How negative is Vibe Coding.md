> Vibe coding is great for speed, terrible for wisdom.

I’ve shipped full features that I **couldn’t explain a week later**. AI makes it worse, or better, depending on how you use it.

By *“working code”* I didn’t fully understand. When things break, and they _always_ break, you need context. You need to know **what changed, why it changed, and how it fits into the system**.

That’s why I started treating *AI like a junior dev* who needs to leave a changelog.
- ✅ What was changed  
- 📦 What was the scope  
- 🤔 Why it was done
